# Graphics-Using-HDL
 In this repo Algorithm regarding Computer graphics are implemented in FPGA hardware For rendering 3D object.
# Results
Simulation results are shown here
## Simulation of The Master Circuit (Graphics Processor)</br>
Here its shown that The processor outputs RGBA values at different pixels in the monitor which is produced by rendering a 3D object.
